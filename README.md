## freebsd-ad.sh: A simple Samba 4 Active Directory provisioning script for FreeBSD 13.0R or later

This script has been tested with the following package versions:

pkg install samba413 ldb22 bind-tools

The script will ask for the basic parameters and report the results and several diagnostics and configuration examples

bind-tools is optional but is suggested for nslookup
